# 📘 JavaScript Fundamentals Tutorials

This repository is a **structured and comprehensive collection of JavaScript tutorials** designed to help learners understand JavaScript from the ground up.

It starts with **core fundamentals** such as hoisting, execution context, and variable declarations, and gradually progresses to **advanced concepts** including closures, asynchronous JavaScript, the event loop, and functional programming techniques.

Each concept is explained with **hands-on examples**, **clear explanations**, and **runnable code**, making this repository ideal for:
- Beginners starting JavaScript
- Intermediate developers strengthening fundamentals
- Interview preparation and concept revision
